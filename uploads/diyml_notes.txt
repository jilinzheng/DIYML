i am training models to detect classes/labels
	build computer vision models, e.g.: azure computervision, amazon rekognition

images (reference uris to a file system) - need to find out how to do file system
	split images into three categories: training, testing, and validation
	each image should have classes/labels

training = generating the model
	YOLO https://towardsdatascience.com/yolo-object-detection-with-opencv-and-python-21e50ac599e9
	resnet
	pre-set configurations

inference = making prediction/getting results
	would need an already-trained model
	inputs would be IMAGE and MODEL -> results
	use roboflow and hugging face etc. to get model?
		but i thought we would train it with some python package, rather than using their apis? would that not be redundant...
		this is for experiment actual training etc. would be something to do later on - which I will do, so I could just do it right now too with scikit-learn

mongodb https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2022-02/mongo-db/
	either install locally or use mongodb online database service (i believe exposed with api)
